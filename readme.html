This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Oz P, Huang M, Wolf F (2015) Action potential initiation in a
multi-compartmental model with cooperatively gating Na channels in the
axon initial segment. J Comput Neurosci 39:63-75

This model was contributed by Pinar Oz.

The model has been verified to run on ubuntu 16.04 and Mac OS 10.11.6

Usage:
------
The model can be compiled with a command like

g++ multicomp.cpp neuron.cpp WB.cpp -o exe

and then run with a command like

./exe

Phase plots can be displayed in MATLAB with commands like:

load filepath3_MP.dat
a=filepath3_MP;
dvdt=diff(a);

figure
f=5
plot(a(2:end,f),dvdt(:,f))
<img src="./screenshot1.png" alt="screenshot 1" width="550">


figure
f=7
plot(a(2:end,f),dvdt(:,f))
<img src="./screenshot2.png" alt="screenshot 2" width="550">
